He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.  The French Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the first \'\'self-proclaimed\'\' anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, \'\'[[What is Property?]]\'\', published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory.<ref>Daniel Guerin, \'\'Anarchism: From Theory to Practice\'\' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).</ref> He developed the theory of [[spontaneous order]] in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests. His famous quote on the matter is "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order". In \'\'What is Property?\'\' Proudhon answers with the famous accusation "[[Property is theft]]." In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed "property" (\'\'propri\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9\'\'), where owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish.<ref name="proudhon-prop">Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. \'\'"[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3.

The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included [[Louise Michel]], the Reclus brothers, and [[Eugene Varlin]] (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised&nbsp;... Moreover, the Commune\'s ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune\'s vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin\'s and Proudhon\'s ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848&nbsp;... and for federation of communes).

More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]\'s imperialist expansion \xe2\x80\x93 in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France\'s leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad." {{Cite journal | last = Anderson | first = Benedict | author-link = Benedict Anderson | title = In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 28 | pages = 85\xe2\x80\x93129 | publisher = New Left Review | date = July\xe2\x80\x93August 2004 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel | ref = harv | postscript = .| access-date = 2016-01-07 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151219130121/http://newleftreview.org/II/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel | archive-date = 2015-12-19 }} </blockquote> According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organization may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].</ref>  Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], President [[Marie Fran\xc3\xa7ois Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] of France, [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]], King [[Umberto I of Italy]], President [[William McKinley]] of the United States, King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and King [[George I of Greece]].

The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers\' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[Direct action]] and [[Workers\' self-management]] Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action \xe2\x80\x93 that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position \xe2\x80\x93 will allow workers to liberate themselves.<ref>Rocker, Rudolf. \'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice\' AK Press (2004) p. 73</ref> Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers\' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet \'\'Anarcho-Syndicalism\'\'. The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries.

It generally views [[patriarchy]] as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by [[decentralised]] free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of [[class struggle]], and the anarchist struggle against the state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. [[L. Susan Brown]] claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist".<ref>Brown, p. 208.</ref> Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Emma Goldman and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]].

It is [[Dimensionless number|dimensionless]] and measured on a scale from zero (corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation) to one (corresponding to a white body that reflects all incident radiation).  Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of irradiance reflected to the irradiance received by a surface. The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth\'s surface.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter9/Ency_Atmos/Reflectance_Albedo_Surface.pdf|title=Reflectance and albedo, surface.

While bi-hemispherical [[reflectance]] is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly or annual averages.  Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire [[Sunlight|spectrum of solar radiation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Henderson-Sellers|first=A.|last2=Wilson|first2=M.F.|year=1983|title=Albedo observations of the Earth\'s surface for climate research|jstor=37357|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A|volume= 309| issue =  1508, The Study of the Ocean and the Land Surfacefrom Satellites|pages=pp. 285\xe2\x80\x93294|bibcode=1983RSPTA.309..285H|doi=10.1098/rsta.1983.0042}}</ref> Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (approximately between 0.3 and 3 \xce\xbcm). This spectrum includes [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] (0.39-0.7 \xce\xbcm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).  Albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and environmental management (e.g., as part of the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings). The average albedo of the Earth at the top of the atmosphere, its \'\'planetary albedo\'\', is 30 to 35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.<ref>Environmental Encyclopedia, 3rd ed., Thompson Gale, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7876-5486-8}}</ref>  The term albedo was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work \'\'[[Photometria]]\'\'.  ==Terrestrial albedo== {| class="wikitable" style="float:right; margin:10px" |+ Sample albedos |- !

As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,<ref name="NASA"/>). These calculations are based on the [[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function|bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)]], which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. Thereby, the BRDF allows to translate observations of reflectance into albedo.  Earth\'s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15&nbsp;\xc2\xb0C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below \xe2\x88\x9240&nbsp;\xc2\xb0C.<ref name="washington" /> If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0&nbsp;\xc2\xb0C.<ref name="clim-past"/> In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water \xe2\x80\x94 a so-called aquaplanet \xe2\x80\x94 the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27&nbsp;\xc2\xb0C.<ref name="Smith Robin"/>  ===White-sky and black-sky albedo=== For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] \'\'\xce\xb8\'\'<sub>\'\'i\'\'</sub> can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, <math>{\\bar \\alpha(\\theta_i)}</math>, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, <math>\\bar{ \\bar \\alpha}</math>, with <math>{D-1}</math> being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and <math>{D}</math> being the proportion of diffuse illumination.  Hence, the actual albedo <math>{\\alpha}</math> (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:  :<math>{\\alpha}= (1-D) \\bar \\alpha(\\theta_i) + D \\bar{ \\bar \\alpha}.</math>  [[Directional-hemispherical reflectance]] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]] as white-sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.<ref name="BlueskyAlbedo"/>  == Astronomical albedo ==  The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[minor planet]]s such as [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.  [[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.

[[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rainforest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}  Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the [[Earth]]. This has been a concern since arctic ice and [[snow]] has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This [[Ice-albedo feedback|feedback loop]] results in a reduced albedo effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721364-commercial-opportunities-are-vastly-outweighed-damage-climate-thawing-arctic|title=The thawing Arctic threatens an environmental catastrophe|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-05-08}}</ref>  ===Climate and weather=== Albedo affects [[climate]] by determining how much [[radiation]] a planet absorbs.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=av7q4N8Ib6sC&pg=PA53&dq=Albedo+affects+climate+by+determining+how+much+radiation+a+planet+absorbs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiawueziOHUAhUN5WMKHVHHCjMQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=Albedo%20affects%20climate%20by%20determining%20how%20much%20radiation%20a%20planet%20absorbs&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather: Abs-Ero|last=Schneider|first=Stephen Henry|last2=Mastrandrea|first2=Michael D.|last3=Root|first3=Terry L.|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199765324|language=en}}</ref> The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive [[weather]].  ===Albedo\xe2\x80\x93temperature feedback=== When an area\'s albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow\xe2\x80\x93temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow\xe2\x80\x93temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.  ===Snow=== Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.<ref>Hall, D.K. and Martinec, J. (1985), Remote sensing of ice and snow. Chapman and Hall, New York, 189 pp.</ref> Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice\xe2\x80\x93albedo [[positive feedback]]). [[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.<ref name = "Nat.

In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.<ref name="ranknfile-ue">{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool!

[[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.<ref name="mmutrees" />  Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.<ref name="Betts" />  ===Water=== Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph). [[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20&nbsp;\xc2\xb0C (refractive index=1.333)]] At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.<ref name="Fresnel" />  Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.  Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh \'black\' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.  ===Clouds=== [[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. "On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth."<ref name="livescience">{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=24 January 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>  Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Contrails reduce daily temperature range|url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|journal=Nature |accessdate=7 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|archivedate=3 May 2006|page=601|volume=418|format=PDF|date=8 August 2002|deadurl=yes|doi=10.1038/418601a|bibcode = 2002Natur.418..601T|pmid=12167846}}</ref> A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&nbsp;\xc2\xb0C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.<ref name="harvard">{{cite journal |title=The Kuwait oil fires as seen by Landsat |publisher=Adsabs.harvard.edu |date=30 May 1991|bibcode=1992JGR....9714565C |author1=Cahalan |first1=Robert F. |volume=97 |page=14565 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres |doi=10.1029/92JD00799|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23842551 }}</ref>  ===Aerosol effects=== [[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth\'s radiative balance.

The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming. * \'\'Aerosol indirect effect.\'\' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (\'\'first indirect effect\'\'), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (\'\'second indirect effect\'\'). </blockquote>  ===Black carbon=== Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m<sup>\xe2\x88\x922</sup>, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m<sup>\xe2\x88\x922</sup>.<ref name="girda 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=19 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.<ref>James Hansen & Larissa Nazarenko, \'\'Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos\'\', 101 Proc. of the Nat\'l.

In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.  The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic script|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin|Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.  ===Typographic variants=== [[File:A-small glyphs.svg|thumb|140px|Different [[glyphs]] of the lowercase letter A.]] During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter "A". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" mediums. There was also a [[cursive]] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the "perishable" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.<ref name=Americana>{{harvnb|Diringer|2000|p=1}}</ref>  [[File:LowercaseA.svg|left|thumb|200px|[[Allography|Typographic variants]] include a double-storey \'\'\'a\'\'\' and single-storey \'\'\'\xc9\x91\'\'\'.]]At the end of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[Italy]], the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the [[Carolingian minuscule|Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.<ref name=Americana/>  15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the \'\'Italic\'\' and \'\'Roman\'\' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called \'\'script a,\'\' is used in most current [[handwriting]] and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers.<ref name="Britannica"/> The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ("a").<ref name=Americana/> Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.  [[Italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where \'\'script a\'\' ("\xc9\x91"), also called [[Latin alpha]], is used in contrast with Latin "a" (such as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]).  ==Use in writing systems== [[File:Pronunciation_of_the_name_of_the_letter_\xe2\x9f\xa8a\xe2\x9f\xa9_in_European_languages.png|thumb|Pronunciation of the name of the letter {{angbr|a}} in European languages, note that /a/ and /a\xcb\x90/ can differ phonetically between {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPAblink|\xc3\xa4}}, {{IPAblink|\xc3\xa6}} and {{IPAblink|\xc9\x91}} depending on the language.|305x305px]]  ===English=== {{further information|Pronunciation of English \xe2\x9f\xa8a\xe2\x9f\xa9}} In modern [[English orthography]], the letter {{angbr|a}} represents at least seven different vowel sounds: *the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/\xc3\xa6/}} as in \'\'pad\'\'; *the [[open back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/\xc9\x91\xcb\x90/}} as in \'\'father\'\', which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound;<ref name=Coll/> *the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/e\xc9\xaa/}} as in \'\'ace\'\' and \'\'major\'\' (usually when {{vr|a}} is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letter) \xe2\x80\x93 this results from [[Middle English lengthening]] followed by the [[Great Vowel Shift]]; *the modified form of the above sound that occurs [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|before {{vr|r}}]], as in \'\'square\'\' and \'\'Mary\'\'; *the rounded vowel of \'\'water\'\'; *the shorter rounded vowel (not present in [[General American]]) in \'\'was\'\' and \'\'what\'\';<ref name="Britannica"/> *a [[schwa]], in many unstressed syllables, as in \'\'about\'\', \'\'comma\'\', \'\'solar\'\'.  The double {{angbr|aa}} sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as \'\'Aaron\'\' and \'\'[[aardvark]]\'\'.<ref>{{harvnb|Gelb|Whiting|1998|p=45}}</ref> However, {{vr|a}} occurs in [[List of Latin-script digraphs|many common digraphs]], all with their own sound or sounds, particularly {{vr|ai}}, {{vr|au}}, {{vr|aw}}, {{vr|ay}}, {{vr|ea}} and {{vr|oa}}.  {{angbr|a}} is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|t}}),<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2004}}</ref> and the second most common in Spanish and French.

An exception is [[Saanich dialect|Saanich]], in which {{angbr|a}} (and the glyph [[\xc3\x81]]) stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}.  ===Other systems===  In phonetic and phonemic notation: *in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angbr|{{IPA|a}}}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{angbr|{{IPA|\xc3\xa4}}}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]], and {{angbr|{{IPA|\xc9\x91}}}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]]. *in [[X-SAMPA]], {{angbr|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and {{angbr|A}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].  ==Other uses== {{main article|A (disambiguation)}} In [[algebra]], the letter \'\'a\'\' along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (\'\'x\'\', \'\'y\'\', \'\'z\'\') are used to denote unknown quantities.  In [[geometry]], capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote [[Line segment|segment]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[Line (geometry)#Ray|rays]], etc.<ref name=Americana/> A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]], the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.<ref name=Coll/>  "A" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students\' schoolwork; "A grade" for clean restaurants; [[A-list]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.<ref>{{harvnb|Ciani & Sheldon|2010|pp=99\xe2\x80\x93100}}</ref>  Finally, the letter A is used to denote size,{{where|date=October 2015}} as in a narrow size shoe,<ref name=Coll/> or a small cup size in a [[brassiere]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  ==Related characters== <!-- Please only list characters (symbols in a writing system, but not just convenience code points in Unicode) that are actually related in terms of origin to the letter that is the topic of this article.
